With layouts, you can make pages in one database look distinct from pages in another database, depending on their use. For example, pages in your database for weekly marketing reports can be built to look very different from your database for team tasks. Layouts also help you keep your database pages clean and easy to navigate, especially when you‚Äôre working with lots of properties. You can bring certain properties to the forefront while keeping others out of sight, all depending on what‚Äôs most important to you and your team. Note: To build a database page layout, you must have at leastCan editaccess to the database."

When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents. Databases are pages themselves But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page. Databases have properties"
