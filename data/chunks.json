You agree to pay Notion the applicable Notion Fees for such services.You will select the pricing for your Paid Template during the listing process based on the options available through the Notion Marketplace. Unless otherwise authorized by Notion, all Paid Templates may only be listed and payable in U.S. dollars. Paid Templates may not be offered through the Notion Marketplace as a mechanism to drive direct or off Notion Marketplace sales (through use of a discount code or otherwise). Should Notion suspect you are engaging in such activity it may suspend or terminate your use of the Notion Marketplace.Payment.Subject to your compliance with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use, for each sale of your Paid Template, we will remit to you the amount we've received for your sale of your Paid Template, less our Notion Fees, and any applicable taxes (\"Net Proceeds\"), in accordance with Notion‚Äôs then standard payment schedule for Paid Templates. You agree to provide the Payment Processor with valid bank account information in your name, so we can remit amounts owed to you to that account via the method we choose. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to you (net of any tax withholding, as further described below) is at least the minimum required payout amount.¬† You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of payments made to you.Refund Mechanics. As noted above, we may issue refunds for your Paid Templates to End Users at any time at our sole discretion without liability. If a refund is issued before you receive the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, you acknowledge that you will have no right to receive such Net Proceeds. If a refund is issued after you‚Äôve received the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, we may offset such Net Proceeds from any amounts owed to you or we may require you to pay us back such Net Proceeds. If Notion can‚Äôt successfully receive payment for any refunded fees owed by you, Notion may cancel your Notion Marketplace account and remove your templates from the Notion Marketplace. Notwithstanding this section, you agree that Notion shall not be responsible for and will not issue any refunds out of its funds (excluding the Notion Fees for the transaction) related to your Paid Template for any reason, including your failure to support the Paid Template. When these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use terminate, we may withhold all payments owed to you for at least 60 days from the date such payments are otherwise due to you in order to ensure we can offset any amounts refunded to End Users or any other amounts we are entitled to.Taxes. Each party is responsible for the payment of all taxes (including any interest and penalties) in connection with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use that are imposed on that party by law. Each party will be responsible for its own income taxes, employment taxes, and real property taxes. You are liable for all applicable taxes imposed on sales of your Paid Templates to End Users, but we will collect sales tax for such transactions and remit such taxes. We reserve the right to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts we owe to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If we were required to collect a tax and did not do so at the time of sale, we reserve the right to later charge you for the applicable tax."
